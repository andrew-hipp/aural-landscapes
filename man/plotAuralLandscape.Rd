\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{data.frame} of observations, with taxon, day, month, year, time (in 24 hr notation)}

\item{plotType}{not currently implemented}

\item{ptSize}{Point size}

\item{dateRange}{Vector of months to include}

\item{timeRange}{Vector of hours to include (24 hr notation)}

\item{observers}{Character vector of length 1; observers to include, or 'all'}

\item{obsGrep}{Boolean; use \code{grep} with \code{observers}?}

\item{taxa}{Character vector of length 1; taxa to include, or 'all'}

\item{taxaGrep}{Boolean; use \code{grep} with \code{taxa}?}

\item{aggregateYears}{Ignore year when plotting, aggregate all dates to yr = 1}

\item{taxonPalette}{Color palette for taxa; default is color-blind with black}

\item{showPlot}{Boolean; plot or just return object?}
}
\description{
\code{plotAuralLandscape} currently does a simple 2-d plot
of observations by time of day and day of year. Eventually
should have functions to (1) accommodate point observations
and ranges, (2) subset by observers and areas, (3) allow
for plotting customization.
